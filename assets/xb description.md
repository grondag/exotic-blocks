Exotic Blocks is a work-in-progress building mod. The mod is still in early stages, with many new blocks and other features still to be added.

REI is recommended to see recipea.

In version for 1.14 and 1.15 it requires [Exotic Matter Library](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/exotic-matter-library). Starting with 1.16, XM is included and you do not need to download it.

Mod ID and block names changed starting in the 1.16 version; Existing pre-1.16 worlds should convert, but please back up your world before trying and log an issue if you have problems.
